# Getting Started with Astro

Welcome to my first blog post! I'm excited to share my journey learning Astro, a modern framework for building fast, content-focused websites.

## Why Astro?

Astro is designed for building content-rich websites with a focus on:

- **Performance**: Ships zero JavaScript by default
- **Flexibility**: Works with React, Vue, Svelte, and more
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive and easy to learn

## What I've Learned

So far, I've discovered that Astro makes it incredibly easy to:

1. Create pages using `.astro` components
2. Write content in Markdown
3. Build blazingly fast websites

## Next Steps

I'm planning to explore:

- Content collections (which power this blog!)
- Component islands
- Integrations with different UI frameworks

Stay tuned for more posts as I continue my Astro journey!
